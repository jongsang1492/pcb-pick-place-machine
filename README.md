SolidWorks-based desktop PnP machine for PCB assembly (2nd-year U of T project)

# Desktop PCB Pick & Place Machine üõ†Ô∏è

This project was completed as part of a second-year engineering design course at the University of Toronto. The objective was to design a compact, desktop-sized automatic Pick and Place (PnP) machine for educational use, capable of handling various PCB assemblies with precision and modularity.

## üîß Project Overview
- Fully modeled in SolidWorks
- Dual nozzle system with rack-and-pinion Z-axis
- Designed for ease of use, component versatility, and mechanical simplicity
- Motion structure based on gantry-style X-Y movement with interchangeable feeders

## üë∑ My Contributions
- Designed the full Z-axis Rack & Pinion lifting mechanism in SolidWorks
- Modeled gear interactions and verified clearances for vertical motion
- Created mechanical drawings and exploded views of the sub-assembly
- Participated in system-level design and mechanical layout review
